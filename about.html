            I have several years of experience in upper-management roles,
            building relationships, and managing projects. Bachelor's in
            Business with a focus in Marketing/Sales/Consumer Relationship
            Management from Florida International University. Wanting career
            change I dove head first into Ironhack's Web Development bootcamp
            and have been developing ever since!

            Every developer starts from somewhere, and for me that was 8
            intensive weeks at Ironhack's coding bootcamp. Simply put I love
            building things with clean, efficent code and seeing my work come to
            life.

          <p>
            Although my career as a developer is just starting, I have over 8
            years of experience in a wide range of environments. My ability to
            adapt and learn, understanding of teamwork, management, people
            skills and desire to succeed makes me a valuable player on any team.

          <p>
            Even in my free time, I love to explore and create things. When I
            travel I never leave leave my camera behind. Digital pictures are
            great for instant sharing and high quality images, but film is where
            the magic happens for me. It's where I learn to focus on my craft,
            take time to appreciate what's on the other side of the lens. There
            is a special moment when you finally get to see your work weeks
            after it was taken, but just like with life, good things take time.
